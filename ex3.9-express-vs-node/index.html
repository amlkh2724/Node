<!-- Some Node.js frameworks similar to Express are Koa.js, Hapi.js, Nest.js, and Meteor.js. Koa.js is lightweight and easy
to use, Hapi.js is powerful and configurable, Nest.js is modular and scalable, and Meteor.js provides a real-time data
synchronization system. The choice of which framework to use depends on your project's specific needs and your personal
preferences. -->
